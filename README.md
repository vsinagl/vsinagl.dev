# vsinagl.dev

My personal website project. It started as a simple Flask tutorial, but I've had quite a bit of fun with this project and played with it a lot, added many new features along the way. In the end, I decided to turn it into my own personal website.
I still have many plans for it. The next big thing I'm working on is a personal CMS and blog. So let's see where it goes ðŸ˜Ž

It's build with python flask, jinja, html, and bootstrap css.
